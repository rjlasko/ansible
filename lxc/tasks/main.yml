- name: install LXC to the host
  when: lxc.host is defined
  include_tasks: host.yml

# XXX: externally add user to 'lxd' group
# TODO: use host-provided bridge network
# TODO: container dedicated MAC address w/ DHCP + DNS
# TODO: where is the default backing storage located? ZFS dataset?
# TODO: permissions supporting running docker in LXC


- name: setup target as lxc container
  when: lxc.container is defined
  include_tasks: container.yml




# XXX: adding the user to the user group 'lxd' enables root-like access to LXD
# this is similar in behavior with the `docker` group
