## Installs rasdaemon to monitor for machine check exceptions ##
## ---------------------------------------------------------- ##

# Machine Check Exceptions are hardware failure events and can be logged to
# journalctl by rasdaemon. Inspect these after after the system has crashed or
# been used for a period of time, using the following commands:
#     `journalctl -f -u rasdaemon`
#     `ras-mc-ctl --errors`

# XXX: there is a known issue with the 0.6.6 version of rasdaemon currently
# available via apt in Debian Bullseye, which causes an error while running
# the ras-mc-ctl command. It can be manually fixed via a patch found in the
# following thread.
