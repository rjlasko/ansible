                    description: >
                      The drivers work by default in asynchronous mode initially but can fall back to synchronous mode
                      if writes to server socket failed (i.e synchronous=auto). This means that all data are pushed by
                      the driver on the communication socket to upsd (Unix socket on Unix, Named pipe on Windows)
                      without waiting for these data to be actually consumed. With some HW, such as ePDUs, that can
                      produce a lot of data, asynchronous mode may cause some congestion, resulting in the socket to be
                      full, and the driver to appear as not connected. In such case, the driver will provide the
                      following debug message: "write XX bytes to socket Y failed"

                      By enabling the synchronous flag (value = yes), the driver will wait for data to be consumed by
                      upsd, prior to publishing more. This can be enabled either globally or per driver.

                      The default of auto acts like no (i.e. asynchronous mode) for backward compatibility of the driver
                      behavior, until communications fail with a "Resource temporarily unavailable" condition, which
                      happens when the driver has many data points to send in a burst, and the server can not handle
                      that quickly enough so the buffer fills up.

                  and reload the configuration when power devices become defined.

                  Boolean values true, yes, on and 1 mean that the server would not refuse to start with zero device
                  sections found in ups.conf.

                  Boolean values false, no, off and 0 mean that the server should refuse to start if zero device

                  Optionally listen on TCP port port instead of the default value which was compiled into the code. This

                  or this value, upsd will listen on port 3493 for this interface.

                  Multiple LISTEN addresses may be specified. The default is to bind to 127.0.0.1 if no LISTEN addresses
                  are specified (and ::1 if IPv6 support is compiled in).

                  To listen on all available interfaces, you may also use 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 and and :: for IPv6.

                  upsmon normally reports polling failures for each device that are in place for each POLLFREQ loop
                  (e.g. "Data stale" or "Driver not connected") to system log as configured. If your devices are
                  expected to be AWOL for an extended timeframe, you can use this throttle to reduce the stress on
                  syslog traffic and storage, by posting these messages only once in every several loop cycles, and when
                  the error condition has changed or cleared.

                  A negative value means standard behavior, and a zero value means to never repeat the message (log only
                  on start and end/change of the failure state).

                  Normally upsmon polls the upsd(8) server every 5 seconds. If this is flooding your network with

                  This is the interval that upsmon waits between polls if any of its UPSes are on battery. You can use
                  this along with POLLFREQ above to slow down polls during normal behavior, but get quicker updates when
                  something bad happens.

                  This should always be equal to or lower than the POLLFREQ value. By default it is also set 5 seconds.

                  upsmon creates this file when running in primary mode when the UPS needs to be powered off. You should
                  check for this file in your shutdown scripts and call upsdrvctl shutdown if it exists.

                  When a UPS says that it needs to have its battery replaced, upsmon will generate a NOTIFY_REPLBATT
                  event. By default, this happens every 43200 seconds (12 hours).
              RUN_AS_USER:
                description: >
                  upsmon normally runs the bulk of the monitoring duties under another user ID after dropping root
                  privileges. On most systems this means it runs as "nobody", since that’s the default from compile-time.

                  The catch is that "nobody" can’t read your upsmon.conf, since by default it is installed so that only
                  root can open it. This means you won’t be able to reload the configuration file, since it will be
                  unavailable.

                  The solution is to create a new user just for upsmon, then make it run as that user. I suggest
                  "nutmon", but you can use anything that isn’t already taken on your system. Just create a regular user
                  with no special privileges and an impossible password.

                  Then, tell upsmon to run as that user, and make upsmon.conf readable by it. Your reloads will work,
                  and your config file will stay secure.

                  This file should not be writable by the upsmon user, as it would be possible to exploit a hole, change
                  the SHUTDOWNCMD to something malicious, then wait for upsmon to be restarted.
              SHUTDOWNCMD:
                description: >
                  upsmon runs this command when the system needs to be brought down. If it is a secondary, it will do
                  that immediately whenever the current overall power value drops below the MINSUPPLIES value above.
